# Seriously! The threat is you run this code on your computer and untrusted input e.g.
# could be supplied from a server you are querying.
#
# HISTORY:
# Back in 2006 it all started with a few openssl commands...
# That's because openssl is a such a good swiss army knife (see e.g.
# https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Utilities) that it was difficult to resist
# wrapping some shell commands around it, which I used for my pen tests. This is how
# everything started.
# Now it has grown up, it has bash socket support for most features, which has been basically
# replacing more and more functions of OpenSSL and some sockets functions serve as some kind
# of central functions.
#
# WHY BASH?
# Cross-platform is one of the three main goals of this script. Second: Ease of installation.
# No compiling, install gems, go to CPAN, use pip etc. Third: Easy to use and to interpret
# the results.
# /bin/bash including the builtin sockets fulfill all that.  The socket checks in bash may sound
# cool and unique -- they are -- but probably you can achieve e.g. the same result with my favorite
# interactive shell: zsh (zmodload zsh/net/socket -- checkout zsh/net/tcp) too! Oh, and btw.
# ksh93 has socket support too.
# Also bash is quite powerful if you use it appropriately: It can operate on patterns, process lines
# and deal perfectly with regular expressions -- without external binaries.
# /bin/bash though is way more often used within Linux and it's perfect for cross platform support.
# MacOS X has it and also under Windows the MSYS2 extension or Cygwin as well as Bash on Windows (WSL)
# has /bin/bash.
#
# Q: So what's the difference to www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ or sslcheck.globalsign.com/ ?
# A: As of now ssllabs only check 1) webservers 2) on standard ports, 3) reachable from the
#    internet. And those examples above 4) are 3rd parties. If these restrictions are all fine
#    with you and you need a management compatible rating -- go ahead and use those.
#
# But also if your fine with those restrictions: testssl.sh is meant as a tool in your hand
# and it's way more flexible.  Oh, and did I mention testssl.sh is open source?

     --file/-iL <fname>            Mass testing option: Reads one testssl.sh command line per line from <fname>.
                                   Can be combined with --serial or --parallel. Implicitly turns on "--warnings batch".
                                   Text format 1: Comments via # allowed, EOF signals end of <fname>

     -S, --server-defaults         displays the server's default picks and certificate info
     -P, --server-preference       displays the server's picks: protocol+cipher
     -x, --single-cipher <pattern> tests matched <pattern> of ciphers

     -4, --rc4, --appelbaum        which RC4 ciphers are being offered?

tuning / connect options (most also can be preset via environment variables):
     --fast                        omits some checks: using openssl for all ciphers (-e), show only first preferred cipher.
     -9, --full                    includes tests for implementation bugs and cipher per protocol (could disappear)
     --bugs                        enables the "-bugs" option of s_client, needed e.g. for some buggy F5s
     --assume-http                 if protocol check fails it assumes HTTP protocol and enforces HTTP checks
     --ssl-native                  fallback to checks with OpenSSL where sockets are normally used
     --openssl <PATH>              use this openssl binary (default: look in \$PATH, \$RUN_DIR of $PROG_NAME)
     --proxy <host:port|auto>      (experimental) proxy connects via <host:port>, auto: values from \$env (\$http(s)_proxy)
     -6                            also use IPv6. Works only with supporting OpenSSL version and IPv6 connectivity
     --ip <ip>                     a) tests the supplied <ip> v4 or v6 address instead of resolving host(s) in URI
                                   b) arg "one" means: just test the first DNS returns (useful for multiple IPs)
     -n, --nodns <min|none>        if "none": do not try any DNS lookups, "min" queries A, AAAA and MX records
     --sneaky                      leave less traces in target logs: user agent, referer
     --ids-friendly                skips a few vulnerability checks which may cause IDSs to block the scanning IP
     --phone-out                   allow to contact external servers for CRL download and querying OCSP responder
     --add-ca <cafile>             path to <cafile> or a comma separated list of CA files enables test against additional CAs.
     --basicauth <user:pass>       provide HTTP basic auth information.

output options (can also be preset via environment variables):
     --quiet                       don't output the banner. By doing this you acknowledge usage terms normally appearing in the banner
     --wide                        wide output for tests like RC4, BEAST. FS also with hexcode, kx, strength, RFC name
     --show-each                   for wide outputs: display all ciphers tested -- not only succeeded ones
     --mapping <openssl|           openssl: use the OpenSSL cipher suite name as the primary name cipher suite name form (default)
                iana|rfc             -> use the IANA/(RFC) cipher suite name as the primary name cipher suite name form
                no-openssl|          -> don't display the OpenSSL cipher suite name, display IANA/(RFC) names only
                no-iana|no-rfc>      -> don't display the IANA/(RFC) cipher suite name, display OpenSSL names only
     --color <0|1|2|3>             0: no escape or other codes,  1: b/w escape codes,  2: color (default), 3: extra color (color all ciphers)
     --colorblind                  swap green and blue in the output
     --debug <0-6>                 1: screen output normal but keeps debug output in /tmp/.  2-6: see "grep -A 5 '^DEBUG=' testssl.sh"
     --disable-rating              Explicitly disables the rating output

file output options (can also be preset via environment variables)
     --log, --logging              logs stdout to '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.log' in current working directory (cwd)
     --logfile|-oL <logfile>       logs stdout to 'dir/\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.log'. If 'logfile' is a dir or to a specified 'logfile'
     --json                        additional output of findings to flat JSON file '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.json' in cwd
     --jsonfile|-oj <jsonfile>     additional output to the specified flat JSON file or directory, similar to --logfile
     --json-pretty                 additional JSON structured output of findings to a file '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.json' in cwd
     --jsonfile-pretty|-oJ <jsonfile>  additional JSON structured output to the specified file or directory, similar to --logfile
     --csv                         additional output of findings to CSV file '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.csv' in cwd or directory
     --csvfile|-oC <csvfile>       additional output as CSV to the specified file or directory, similar to --logfile
     --html                        additional output as HTML to file '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.html'
     --htmlfile|-oH <htmlfile>     additional output as HTML to the specified file or directory, similar to --logfile
     --out(f,F)ile|-oa/-oA <fname> log to a LOG,JSON,CSV,HTML file (see nmap). -oA/-oa: pretty/flat JSON.
                                   "auto" uses '\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}'. If fname if a dir uses 'dir/\${NODE}-p\${port}\${YYYYMMDD-HHMM}'
     --hints                       additional hints to findings
     --severity <severity>         severities with lower level will be filtered for CSV+JSON, possible values <LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL>
     --append                      if (non-empty) <logfile>, <csvfile>, <jsonfile> or <htmlfile> exists, append to file. Omits any header
     --outprefix <fname_prefix>    before  '\${NODE}.' above prepend <fname_prefix>


Options requiring a value can also be called with '=' e.g. testssl.sh -t=smtp --wide --openssl=/usr/bin/openssl <URI>.
<URI> always needs to be the last parameter.
