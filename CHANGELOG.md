      (normal use case makes most sense here)
  - ENV J_POSITIV --> SHOW_EACH_C
- finding mapping-rfc.txt is now a bit smarter
- preparations for ChaCha20-Poly1305 (would have provided binaries but
  "openssl s_client -connect" with that ciphersuite fails currently with

- output for RC4+PFS now better (with headline, bits separate, spacing improved)
- both also sorted by encr. strength .. umm ..err bits!

1.80
