* Dirk Wetter (creator, maintainer and main contributor)
  - Everything what's not mentioned below and is included in testssl.sh's git log
    minus what I probably forgot to mention
  (too much other things to do at the moment and to list it would be a tough job)

* David Cooper (main contributor)
  - Major extensions to socket support for all protocols
  - extended parsing of TLS ServerHello messages
  - TLS 1.3 support (final and pre-final) with needed en/decryption
  - add several TLS extensions
  - Detection + output of multiple certificates
  - several cleanups of server certificate related stuff
  - testssl.sh -e/-E: testing with a mixture of openssl + sockets
  - add more ciphers
  - coloring of ciphers
  - extensive CN+SAN <--> hostname check
  - separate check for curves
  - RFC 7919, key shares extension
  - keyUsage extension in certificate
  - experimental "eTLS" detection
  - parallel mass testing!
  - RFC <--> OpenSSL cipher name space switches for the command line
  - better error msg suppression (not fully installed openssl)
  - GREASE support
  - Bleichenbacher / ROBOT vulnerability test
  - several protocol preferences improvements
  - pwnedkeys.com support
  - CT support
  - Extract CA list CertificateRequest message is encountered
  - RFC 8879, certificate compression
  - 128 cipher limit, padding
  - compatibility for LibreSSL and different OpenSSL versions
  - Check for ffdhe groups
  - TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 sig algs added
  - Show server supported signature algorithms
  - Show supported certification authorities sent by the server when client auth is requested
  - Provide a better verdict wrt to server order: Now per protocol and ciphers are weighted for each protocol
 -  Provide compatibility to every LibreSSL/OpenSSL versions
  - Lots of fixes and improvements
